## Go provides

1. concurrent execution (goroutines)
2. synchronization and messaging (channels)
3. multi-way concurrent control (select)

## Definitions

### 1. Concurrency
- Programming as the composition of independently executing processes.

### 2. Parallelism

- Programming as the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.

## Goroutines
> A goroutine is a function running independently in the same address space as other goroutines.

## Channels
> Channels allow goroutines to communicate and exchange information with each other.

## Select
> Select is a statement based on the decision, whether or not it can communicate with the given channels
